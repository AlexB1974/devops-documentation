\# Cover Letter ‚Äî Alex Brixbacken



Dear Hiring Manager,



I am writing to express my interest in opportunities related to IT infrastructure, automation, or DevOps engineering. As a proactive intern at Bigif AB and a student at KTH and JENSEN Yrkesh√∂gskola, I have developed hands-on experience in cloud automation, infrastructure documentation, and CI/CD pipelines using tools such as AWS, Terraform, Ansible, and GitHub Actions.



During my internship, I built a DevOps documentation generator that automated infrastructure reporting using Python and LaTeX. This project not only improved internal workflows but also demonstrated my ability to translate complex technical processes into clear, reproducible documentation. I thrive in multilingual environments and am fluent in Spanish, Swedish, and English‚Äîskills that support both technical collaboration and client-facing communication.



I am particularly drawn to roles that value clarity, automation, and continuous improvement. My background in both academic and practical settings has equipped me to contribute to teams focused on scalable infrastructure and efficient DevOps workflows.



I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your organization‚Äôs goals. Thank you for considering my application.



Sincerely,  

\*\*Alex Brixbacken\*\*
